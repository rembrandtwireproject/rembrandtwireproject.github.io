          <h2>Welcome to the WIRE project.</h2>
          <p>The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project aims to simplify the process of confidently identifying watermarks in Rembrandt’s etchings. The often-subtle differences between watermark subvariants can be difficult to distinguish. This student-designed program is based on the model of a decision tree, a branching series of questions. The questions allow researchers to inspect a watermark and arrive at a subvariant classification, and provides a guide to distinguishing the subvariants. Eventually, all watermark types and subvariants from Hinterding’s 2006 book <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher</i> will be included in this tool.</p>
          <p>To learn more about the project, see the <a href="about">About</a> page, take a look at the <a href="team">Project Team</a>, or investigate further <a href="resources">Resources</a>.</p>
          <p>For this demo, a subset of watermark types are offered. Researchers with watermarks of interest can use their own watermark images to run through the decision tree. For other interested users, we have provided several options to choose from. After choosing a comparative image, either from our selection or your own, follow the series of questions and images to find your watermark’s subvariant classification.</p>
          <p>Enjoy!</p>
