        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>The Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project is a cross-disciplinary research project largely driven by student effort under the guidance of Andrew C. Weislogel and C. Richard Johnson, Jr. The project carries on the legacy of watermark and paper study established by Erik Hinterding’s book <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher: The Practice of Production and Distribution</i>. In the process of manufacturing European laid papers, the artisans attached watermarks, designs made from bent wire, to the grid of each paper mold to indicate the maker or geographical origin. Studying and systematically cataloguing Rembrandt’s watermarks can help reveal his printing practices and date his prints with increased accuracy. The WIRE project aims not only to build an interrogatory, computer-based interface that delivers a definitive watermark identification according to the fifty-four types of Rembrandt watermarks encompassed in Hinterding’s taxonomy, but also to construct a larger database through engagement with colleges and museums.</p>
        <p>WIRE's identification tool is based on the model of the decision tree, a branching graph that allows the researcher to visualize all possible outcomes of a series of decisions. Students in the project construct decision trees branches for watermark types with binary answers about features of the watermark and its placement on the mold, and in doing so systematically author a comprehensive description of the physical characteristics of every single Rembrandt watermark down to the subvariant level. The interface will eventually allow a user to upload a watermark image in any format in the image editor box and select the matching watermark type from choices provided. The user then follows the short sequence of questions provided, with annotated images supplied for further guidance. The user may backtrack or start over at any time. Ultimately, the user will find an exact match with the subvariant letter designation found in Hinterding's 2006 book.</p>
