            <h3>Your watermark is Eagle, Single-Headed, A.a.</h3>
            <p>Watermark A.a. has three notable characteristics: the eagle does not contain a Basel crosier at its center, its wings point downward, and a chain line touches but does not intersect its beak (marked with red). Some of these characteristics are visible in this fragment image.</p> <p>________________________________________________________________________</p> <p>This watermark can be found on the following print:</p> <p><i>Self-portrait (?) with jewel in cap</i>, at the British Museum, London.</p> <p>NOTE: This is a quarto sized print, meaning it was printed on one-quarter of a full sheet of paper. In the process of tearing the paper, the portion of paper containing the watermark was divided. This print contains a small portion of the watermark- just the eagle’s head and crown, so it is thus considered a fragment. Other print(s) made from this sheet of paper would contain the remainder of the watermark, and it is possible that an etching could be found that contains the complementary fragment.</p> <p>(Erik Hinterding, <i>Rembrandt as an Etcher</i>, 2006, II, 104)</p>
